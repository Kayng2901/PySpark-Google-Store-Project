# PySpark-Google-Store-Project
â€¢ Analyzed a set of 10,847 Google Store applications on Databricks using PySpark. In the virtual environment provided by Databricks, I loaded and cleaned the data before doing analysis using SQL to get metrics such as Top 10 installed apps, best-rated paid apps, and best-rated free apps.
